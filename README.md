# Webpack
For easist development i will make my favorite webpack assembly. 
## Worked
- [x] PUG
- [x] SCSS/SASS
- [x] File loader (img, fonts and another...)

## NPM scripts

#### To start locally 
- ```npm run watch``` for development environment in watch mode

#### To build project 
- ```npm run build``` will create build folder in the project folder
